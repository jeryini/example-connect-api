Purpose
-------
This repo will contain examples of how to authenticate with and call endpoints of the TrustYou Connect API.

It's expected that we'll have examples in multiple programming languages.

As specified, this is currently just a collection of examples, and NOT a full-featured library.
Use this to implement your own clients.
